## Our Mission

We are a group of students at the University of Washington who are passionate about raising awareness about gender inequality. Our goal is to create a web application that makes it easy for people to learn about the gender wage gap throughout the U.S. and find ways to get involved in the fight for gender equality.

As a team, we believe in the power of education and community action to drive change. Our web application is designed to provide accessible and comprehensive information about the gender wage gap in the U.S. and to empower users to make a difference. By creating an interactive map and a "Get Involved" section, we hope to encourage individuals to learn more about this important issue and to take action in their local communities. Ultimately, our goal is to contribute to the larger movement for gender equality and to help close the gender wage gap.

## User Testing

After conducting user testing, our team identified several takeaways. Users found the state-based map and heatmap helpful features, but some had difficulty with the industry-based graph slider and suggested improvements such as adding a dollar amount or making it larger. Users suggested expanding on statistics, such as showing the margin of error, and some suggested adding a disclaimer about the data. Incremental filters were recommended to make getting to a specific number easier. The feedback from users will be used to improve the product and better meet users' needs.

## Features

- Interactive Map: The centerpiece feature of our application is an interactive map built using Tableau. The map displays information about the gender wage gap in different states across the U.S.

- Get Involved: Our "Get Involved" section is designed to empower users to take action in their local communities. Users can search for and filter local charities by location and category to find organizations that align with their interests and values.

- About Us: Our "About Us" section introduces the team and their motivation for this project. We share our thoughts on why we believe it's important to raise awareness about the gender wage gap and what we hope to accomplish with this web application.
